## Overview

The Rental Agency Platform helps rental agencies manage properties, capture leads, track rentals and transactions, and coordinate teams from a single mobile-first dashboard.

## Philosophy

- **Mobile-first**: Built for field agents and mobile users.
- **Multi-tenant**: Supports per-agency data separation and user access.
- **Collaborative**: Enables teams to work together while preserving individual ownership.
- **Extensible**: Designed to integrate with external services like Twilio, WhatsApp, Instagram, and payment providers.
- **Secure**: Uses JWT authentication, role-based access, and SMS verification for sensitive operations.

## Core Features

- Authentication and agency-level access control
- Property management with media upload and availability calendars
- Lead tracking and visit scheduling
- Rental contract and payment tracking
- Team member roles, permissions, and KPI reporting
- Transaction management and virtual phone provisioning
- Public property and transaction pages
- Integration-ready architecture for third-party connectors

## Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo with separate backend and frontend applications.

- `backend/`: NestJS API, MongoDB models, authentication, business modules
- `frontend/`: Angular SPA, mobile-first dashboard, public marketing experience
- `docker-compose.yml`: Local development orchestration with MongoDB

## Tech Stack

- Backend: NestJS 10, TypeScript, Mongoose, JWT, Passport
- Frontend: Angular 21, TypeScript, RxJS, standalone components
- Database: MongoDB 7
- Media: Cloudinary
- SMS: Twilio
- Containerization: Docker
